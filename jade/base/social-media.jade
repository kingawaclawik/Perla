meta(property='og:description', itemprop='description', content="Established in 1846, the Perla Brewery is Poland’s largest independent brewery. We think of ourselves as the last real Polish brewery. Based in Lublin, Poland Perla is in the heart of the source of the world-famous Lublin (saaz) hops. Perla draws its water from deep-water Oligocene wells in the least-industrialized region of Europe. In brewing, Perla employs the traditional bottom-brewing process with cold 12.5*C water allowing the yeast cells to drop to the bottom for fermentation. Although this is a time-consuming brewing process, it ensures Perla’s consistent premium quality. The end result is a beer excellent clarity combined with a hoppy odor and slight bitterness with and ABV of 5.6%.")
